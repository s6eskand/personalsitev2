### Sam Eskandar, Personal Website

My personal website, an ongoing and never ending project to display my projects and skills in a creative way to also show off my front-end development skills.

Also includes my personal blog, updated weekly with posts by myself as well as a featured 'blog post of the week' written by another student, and talented writer!

The website can be found at https://sameskandar.me and the blog at https://sameskandar.me/blog
